Question 130/135:
Question: Which researcher published papers in 2007?
Expected Answer: Saiful Azad
Model Answer: Short answer
I cannot find any researcher in the provided tables who published papers in 2007.

What I checked
- The dataset contains many publication-year entries (examples include 2008, 2017, 2019, 2018, 2021, 2023, 2024, 2025), but no record shows 2007. This is supported by the listed source records that show years other than 2007 [Data: Sources (15); Sources (27); Sources (37); Relationships (262)].

Conclusion
Based on the tables you supplied, there is no evidence of any researcher publishing in 2007. If you have additional data (other source records or files) that might contain 2007 publications, please share them and I will re-check.

Question 131/135:
Question: Which researchers published papers in 2013?
Expected Answer: MA Razzaque
Model Answer: Summary

Per the provided data, the following researchers (and author groups) are recorded as having published papers in 2013.

Details

- AK Das — author of a 2013 paper in The International (recorded in the dataset) [Data: Sources (59); Relationships (327); Entities (297)].

- Authors of a 2013 paper in the International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks — I Anjum; N Alam; MA Razzaque; M Mehedi Hassan; and A Alamri (these names appear as the paper’s authors in the dataset) [Data: Sources (16)].

- Dr. Md. Abdur Razzaque — recorded in the dataset as a co‑author associated with the International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks (the dataset links him to that journal/publication) [Data: Relationships (103); Entities (90)].

Notes and caveats

- I listed names exactly as they appear in the source records; the dataset shows both “MA Razzaque” among the paper authors and “Dr. Md. Abdur Razzaque” as a linked co‑author of the same journal, but it does not explicitly state in these records whether those two name forms refer to the same individual. I have not conflated or inferred identity beyond what the records provide.

Question 132/135:
Question: Which researchers published papers in 2012?
Expected Answer: Saiful Azad
Model Answer: Summary

- The provided dataset contains an event/publication record for "2012 OCEANS‑YEOSU" but does not list a clear, complete set of author names tied to 2012 publications in the Entities or Relationships tables. The event record is present in the Entities table [Data: Entities (106)].
- One source entry references a 2012 "Oceans‑Yeosu" publication and begins with an author name fragment ("P Casari..."), but that source text is truncated in the provided data so a full author list for 2012 cannot be confirmed from these tables alone [Data: Sources (20)].

What I can say from the tables

- The dataset explicitly records the 2012 OCEANS‑YEOSU event/publication [Data: Entities (106)].
- A source item in the Sources table references a 2012 Oceans‑Yeosu publication and includes the fragment "P Casari..." but the full author information is not available in the provided excerpt [Data: Sources (20)].

Limitations and next steps

- The tables you supplied do not contain a complete, explicit list of researcher names paired with a 2012 publication year (no Entities or Relationships entries clearly show authors with year = 2012 except the event entry and the truncated source).
- If you can share the full source text for the 2012 Oceans‑Yeosu entry or upload additional records that list authors with their publication years, I can extract and list all researchers who published in 2012 from the dataset.

- MA Razzaque also appears as a co‑author on an IEEE Communications Magazine paper dated 2011 alongside MM Rahman, CS Hong, S Lee, J Lee, and JH Kim [Data: Sources (6)].

Details / supporting notes

- The Sensors 2011 paper "Data‑centric multiobjective QoS‑aware routing protocol for body sensor networks" is documented in the dataset and is explicitly dated 2011; Dr. Md. Abdur Razzaque (MA Razzaque) is identified with that work and CS Hong and S Lee are listed as co‑authors [Data: Reports (27)].
