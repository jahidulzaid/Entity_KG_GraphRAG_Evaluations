132,Which researchers published papers in 2012?,Saiful Azad,"Summary

- The provided dataset contains an event/publication record for ""2012 OCEANS‑YEOSU"" but does not list a clear, complete set of author names tied to 2012 publications in the Entities or Relationships tables. The event record is present in the Entities table [Data: Entities (106)].
- One source entry references a 2012 ""Oceans‑Yeosu"" publication and begins with an author name fragment (""P Casari...""), but that source text is truncated in the provided data so a full author list for 2012 cannot be confirmed from these tables alone [Data: Sources (20)].

What I can say from the tables

- The dataset explicitly records the 2012 OCEANS‑YEOSU event/publication [Data: Entities (106)].
- A source item in the Sources table references a 2012 Oceans‑Yeosu publication and includes the fragment ""P Casari..."" but the full author information is not available in the provided excerpt [Data: Sources (20)].

Limitations and next steps

- The tables you supplied do not contain a complete, explicit list of researcher names paired with a 2012 publication year (no Entities or Relationships entries clearly show authors with year = 2012 except the event entry and the truncated source).
- If you can share the full source text for the 2012 Oceans‑Yeosu entry or upload additional records that list authors with their publication years, I can extract and list all researchers who published in 2012 from the dataset.","Summary
- The provided dataset contains an event/publication record for ""2012 OCEANS‑YEOSU"" but does not list a clear, complete set of author names tied to 2012 publications in the Entities or Relationships tables. The event record is present in the Entities table [Data: Entities (106)].
- One source entry references a 2012 ""Oceans‑Yeosu"" publication and begins with an author name fragment (""P Casari...""), but that source text is truncated in the provided data so a full author list for 2012 cannot be confirmed from these tables alone [Data: Sources (20)].
What I can say from the tables
- The dataset explicitly records the 2012 OCEANS‑YEOSU event/publication [Data: Entities (106)].
- A source item in the Sources table references a 2012 Oceans‑Yeosu publication and includes the fragment ""P Casari..."" but the full author information is not available in the provided excerpt [Data: Sources (20)].
Limitations and next steps
- The tables you supplied do not contain a complete, explicit list of researcher names paired with a 2012 publication year (no Entities or Relationships entries clearly show authors with year = 2012 except the event entry and the truncated source).
- If you can share the full source text for the 2012 Oceans‑Yeosu entry or upload additional records that list authors with their publication years, I can extract and list all researchers who published in 2012 from the dataset.",,False
133,Which researchers published papers in 2011?,"S Lee, CS Hong, MA Razzaque, Dr. Md. Abdur Razzaque, MM Rahman, JH Kim, J Lee","Summary

From the provided data, the researchers in the dataset who have publications dated 2011 are:
- Dr. Md. Abdur Razzaque (listed as MA Razzaque) — author of the 2011 Sensors paper ""Data‑centric multiobjective QoS‑aware routing protocol for body sensor networks"" [Data: Reports (27)].
- The co‑authors on 2011 publications that include MA Razzaque are CS Hong and S Lee (co‑authors on the Sensors 2011 paper) [Data: Reports (27)].  
- MA Razzaque also appears as a co‑author on an IEEE Communications Magazine paper dated 2011 alongside MM Rahman, CS Hong, S Lee, J Lee, and JH Kim [Data: Sources (6)].

Details / supporting notes

- The Sensors 2011 paper ""Data‑centric multiobjective QoS‑aware routing protocol for body sensor networks"" is documented in the dataset and is explicitly dated 2011; Dr. Md. Abdur Razzaque (MA Razzaque) is identified with that work and CS Hong and S Lee are listed as co‑authors [Data: Reports (27)].
- A separate 2011 IEEE Communications Magazine entry in the dataset lists MA Razzaque among the authors together with MM Rahman, CS Hong, S Lee, J Lee, and JH Kim (this shows MA Razzaque had at least one additional 2011 co‑authorship) [Data: Sources (6)].
